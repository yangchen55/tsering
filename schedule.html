          <td><strong>Building Shiny Web Apps with TypeScript and Angular 2</strong><br><em>DUSTIN EWERS - Software Consultant - Centare</em><br>From humble beginnings, JavaScript has gone from a hastily thrown together language for web pages to a hastily
            thrown together language that runs everywhere. If you can do it with code, you can probably do it in JavaScript. It's the Swiss Army Knife of programming languages. Unfortunately, JavaScript wasn't designed for the large scale apps we use
            it in today. We've had to rely on design patterns, willpower, and luck to mitigate JavaScript's failings. However, there is a better way. TypeScript adds features to JavaScript that make it usable on large projects. Additionally, the bar for
            web applications gets higher everyday. jQuery was cool ten years ago, but it doesn't cut it for modern web apps. We need something with a little more horsepower. Angular 2 makes it easy to build clean, modular web apps. In this talk, we'll
            explore TypeScript and Angular 2 and how they can be used together to build large-scale web applications. We will learn how to get started and get up to speed quickly.<br><br><strong>Speed vs. Speed to Market</strong><br><em>JEREMY WAGNER - Senior App Developer - General Mills</em><br>Performance
            is often glossed over in project planning. As such, many sites are already sluggish when they hit production. This is often because speed to market wins out over speed itself. In this session, you'll learn how to be an advocate for performance
            early on in the game. You'll also learn how to measure performance throughout development, and use modern tooling to optimize as you code. ABSTRACT: We all agree that web performance is important, but in our zeal to be first to market, we
            don’t realize that performance problems exist until a site is already in production. This talk is intended to arm developers and other technically-inclined professionals with knowledge that will help them be proactive in addressing this difficult
            problem. In this session, you’ll learn to do the following: - Evoke genuine concern for performance by helping your colleagues identify your site’s target audience, and identify that audience’s capabilities by using data from Akamai’s State
            of the Internet connectivity report. - How to use this newly-acquired information in concert with automated testing tools to approximate what key performance metrics will be for your users. - How to interpret data gathered from these tools
            and use them to set meaningful performance budgets for your project. - Spring into action by automating optimization tasks with Node and gulp, so that you’ll be optimizing as you develop, instead of after the fact. - Some techniques for achieving
            quick performance wins for troublesome sites already in production, such as resource hints, PostCSS and more.<br><br><strong>Using AWS Lambda to Create Weather GIFs</strong><br><em>EDAN SCHWARTZ - Software Engineer - AerisWeather</em><br><em>SETH MILLER - Software Engineer - AerisWeather</em><br>We

            you may run into with Lambda: &quot;How do I logically organize my code? How do I maintain state in a &quot;stateless&quot; environment'? How do I define data transformation pipelines?&quot; We will also talk through our decision-making process
            in using Lambda, and discuss how it it changed the way we think about our code.<br><br><strong>Web Application Vulnerability Testing with OWASP’s ZAP and Webgoat</strong><br><em>DAMODAR CHETTY - Architect - US Bank</em><br>OWASP's ZAP is an
            amazingly full featured web hacking toolkit - combining an intercepting proxy with HTTPS support, spidering, as well as passive and active vulnerability scanning capabilities. It also has a great pedigree - it is a flagship project of the
            Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) and started life as a fork of the Paros proxy. And the best part is that unlike its competition, ZAP is completely free! All this results in a package that provides an easy entry into the world
            of web application vulnerability testing. In this hour, we'll consider how to leverage the features of this interesting tool against an intentionally vulnerable web application - OWASP's WebGoat. In the process, we'll also discuss some common
            web application vulnerabilities, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF).<br><br><strong>Technological Advancements in the Transportation Ecosystem</strong><br><em>ARI SILKEY - GM &amp; Executive Lead MSP Office - Amazon</em><br>Details

            distributed systems means considering failure scenarios—both likely and less so. Will the network let you down? (Almost assuredly.) Will some portion of your IaaS misbehave? (Have you met computers?) We build in graceful degradation for much
            of our automation but often neglect the (just-as-essential) human interactions. The classic “hard problems” of cache invalidation and naming things revolve around our understanding of what’s correct and true and our agreements with one another
            on scope and relevance. Communication is essential for making context-dependent decisions. Whether we’re attempting to determine the current state of reality or distinguish logical boundaries, democratized observability is key to answering
            our questions. As the fractal complexity of our distributed systems grows, we need to mindfully choose practices that work with our tooling. You can’t buy a silver bullet, but you can forge one from the collaborative efforts of your team.<br><br><strong>TDD on a Deadline</strong><br><em>ALLISON KNAUSS - Senior Software Engineer - The Nerdery</em><br>Test-driven
            development is often presented in an idealized form that can turn away a busy developer. But it also offers tantalizing code quality and maintenance benefits if only it can be made to provide the most value for your time. In this presentation,
            we will use an implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Kotlin to explore a production-tested approach to TDD that lets you capitalize on its strengths while still meeting your deadline. A functionally equivalent Python implementation will
            also be available.<br><br><strong>Ada to Zuckerberg</strong><br><em>CAROLINE KARANJA - Founder/CEO - 26 Letters</em><br>Although women like Ada Lovelace and Grace Hopper pioneered computer programming, today's tech culture often excludes or

            Alexa platform is taking the world by storm, helping empower smart homes around the world. But what many developers may not realize is that this is not a closed platform, in fact it has a thriving marketplace for programs, or Skills as Amazon
            calls them. This talk will walk you through the process of creating a simple Skill for Alexa, and deploying into AWS Lambda. Working copies of the code base will be provided (via GitHub repo) so that attendees should be able to have a skill
            of their own deployed by the end of the session, which they can then enhance to their heart's content.<br><br><strong>UI Test Kitchen</strong><br><em>JAY LANDRO - UI Engineer - SDG</em><br>UI Testing has historically been a daunting and fragile
            experience. Declarative UI structures and advancements in the JavaScript language itself are bringing about rapid radical approaches to UI testing guaranteed to boost productivity and delight clients.</td>

          <td><strong>Live Code: 2 Player Game of Pigs in a Pen</strong><br><em>JUSTIN PERINOVIC - Senior Consultant - Object Partners</em><br>React is a powerful rendering tool well-suited to the rapid development of interaction-heavy functionalities. To
            demonstrate that, we will have a bit of fun by creating a 2-player game of “Pigs in a Pen” using React and Redux. We will start with some simple boilerplate and bring the project to completion by exploring key React/Redux concepts while writing
            real code live, on the spot. This talk will provide a first-hand example of React's power and simplicity, while also providing exposure to all the basic building blocks of a typical production-ready React application at a small scale.<br><br><strong>The Static Web Revolution</strong><br><em>STEVEN HICKS - Developer - Centare</em><br>The
            web is changing. For years it has been built on frameworks that run on the server. These dynamic back-ends give you the ability to do many things, but they come with a price - complexity, performance, and security. But static websites are
            back. Static websites have no back-end and are simply HTML, but the modern tools for building them are remarkable. In this session, we'll survey the landscape of static site generation. We'll look back at the history of the web and identify
            the ideal scenario for static websites. We'll look at the simple tooling you can use to get a high-performance, secure website on the internet in a matter of minutes. We will also discuss the mighty JAM stack, and look at the many services
            available to make static websites interactive. Static websites help you eliminate unnecessary architecture and complexity. If you've found yourself spinning up an instance of a CMS and the complexity didn't feel right to you, this session
            is for you.<br><br><strong>Serverless Computing on Azure with Logic Apps and Functions</strong><br><em>MATT MILNER - Chief Everything Officer - M3 Technology Partners Inc.</em><br>Cloud computing promises to simplify your development by removing
            the concerns of physical computers from your process. Despite that, most cloud solutions use virtual machines or some form of server instances that you manage and scale. “Serverless” solutions provide true computing without any concerns about
            “instances”. Azure Logic Apps provide workflow and integration capabilities focused on your application logic and not deployment. You code your logic application, deploy to an environment, and the underlying compute processing and scaling
            is managed for you. Likewise, Azure Functions provide the ability to write and run code at scale in the cloud without having to package code or provision computing instances. Code (C#, F#, JavaScript, Python, PowerShell, Bash, etc.) can be
            triggered by time and events or called via a webhook. These two offerings, which both integrate well with other web and Azure services, together provide a platform for rich application development without concern for managing the infrastructure.
            Learn how to build solutions using these tools and integrate them in solutions and with your current tool chain using continuous integration.<br><br><strong>Liferay 7—Modern UIs and Modularity</strong><br><em>JAMIE SAMMONS - Developer Advocate - Liferay</em><br>The
            purpose of this talk is to demonstrate creating a simple application by combining a μServices backend with a ReactJS front end using Liferay 7’s new modular architecture. Liferay 7 has shifted from being a single monolithic application to
            being composed using a series of modules. Using this combination along with the platforms service layer it’s easy to build a simple interactive application that does not require page reloading.<br><br><strong>Visualizing Boundaries with Microservices</strong><br><em>JOEL TOSI - Playing Coach - DevJam</em><br>How
            do you embrace cloud and microservices and not risk getting into different failure scenarios or overly complicated maintenance and ripple effects? In this session we will walk through visualizations that help teams blend product thinking with
            architecture. Along the way, we will look at microservices and domain modeling as well as chaos engineering and fault tolerance - blending all of these into a context that is consumable by all and gives the right emphasis at the right time.
            Leave this session with simple visualizations and approaches that you can apply immediately to start blending product with architecture, especially if you are looking to run in a cloud world.<br><br><strong>Log Analytics with the Elastic Stack</strong><br><em>MICHAEL HELDEBRANT - Solutions Architect - Elastic</em><br>How
            to build an end to end platform for log and metrics analytics with the Elastic Stack, sending data with Beats, processing with Logstash and Elasticsearch Ingest node, storage and queries with Elasticsearch, and visualizations with Kibana.</td>
